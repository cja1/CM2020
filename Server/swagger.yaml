        <br/><br/>We use Bearer authentication for requests to the Sequence API
        endpoints. The token is simply a UUID generated by the client. The UUID
        must remain the same between requests to uniquely identify the Player.
        In the code examples in the API documentation, replace {access-token}
        with a valid UUID.
